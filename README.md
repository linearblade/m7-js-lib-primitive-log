Log Primitive

A synchronous event/log capture primitive designed for live inspection, high-throughput instrumentation, and composable observability pipelines.

This project exists because most logging systems conflate event capture with transport, async scheduling, and policy, making them slow, opaque, or brittle under real-world load.

This library does one thing well:
capture structured log events synchronously with bounded memory and explicit extension points.

It is a primitive, not a framework.

⸻

Why this exists

If you have ever:
	•	Needed to inspect logs live without shipping them anywhere
	•	Had async logging introduce latency, ordering issues, or hidden drops
	•	Been forced into deep cloning when you didn’t need it
	•	Wanted deterministic timing metadata without scheduling complexity
	•	Needed a hook point without committing to a transport or backend

Then you have already discovered the limits of “full-featured” logging frameworks.

This library solves those problems by separating capture from policy.

⸻

What this library guarantees
	•	Log capture is synchronous and deterministic
	•	Storage is explicitly bounded (unlimited or ring buffer)
	•	Records have a strict header/body split
	•	Timing metadata is explicit and reliable (at, lastAt, delta)
	•	Mutation safety is opt-in, not forced
	•	Hooks (onEvent, onPrint) are best-effort and non-fatal
	•	No async work is hidden or implied

These guarantees are enforced by design, not convention.

Quick example (safe by default)

import { Manager } from 'primitive-log';

const log = new Manager();

log.createBucket('errors');

log.log('errors', new Error('boom'), {
  level: 'error'
});

By default this:
	•	Stores records synchronously
	•	Uses in-memory storage only
	•	Does not clone payloads
	•	Does not ship data anywhere
	•	Does not block on async work

No configuration required.

Core concepts

Manager

A registry and convenience layer responsible for:
	•	Managing named log buckets (Workers)
	•	Applying shared defaults
	•	Providing a single entrypoint (log(bucket, data, opts))

Think of it as the control plane.

⸻

Worker

A single log stream with its own:
	•	Storage policy (unlimited or ring buffer)
	•	Enable/disable switch
	•	Console emission policy
	•	Optional event hook (onEvent)
	•	Optional printer (onPrint)
	•	Clock source
	•	Workspace

Think of it as the execution plane.

⸻

Synchronous by design

This library is intentionally synchronous.
	•	emit() / log() return immediately
	•	onEvent is invoked synchronously and not awaited
	•	Async handlers are allowed, but must manage their own backpressure

This ensures:
	•	predictable performance
	•	no hidden scheduling
	•	no surprise latency

Async work belongs outside the primitive.

⸻

Mutation & cloning semantics

By default, logged payloads are stored by reference.

This is intentional.

Clone policy

Cloning is:
	•	off by default
	•	opt-in per Worker or per call
	•	best-effort, not guaranteed

log.log('errors', data, { clone: true });

Cloning uses:
	1.	structuredClone when available
	2.	lib.utils.deepCopy if present
	3.	original reference as a fallback

This keeps the hot path fast and puts responsibility where it belongs.

⸻

Timing metadata

Each record includes:
	•	header.at – timestamp of emission
	•	header.lastAt – timestamp of previous record in the same bucket (if any)
	•	header.delta – time difference between records

This enables:
	•	burst detection
	•	sampling logic
	•	rate estimation
	•	heatmaps

No async scheduling required.

⸻

Hooks without policy

onEvent

onEvent(record, worker, workspace)

	•	Called synchronously after a record is accepted
	•	Errors are swallowed
	•	Return value is ignored

This hook exists to signal external systems, not to run them.

Typical uses:
	•	enqueue into a queue
	•	increment counters
	•	trigger async pipelines

⸻

onPrint

onPrint(record, ctx, workspace)

Used for console output only.

Console printing is often the largest performance cost and should be used selectively.

⸻

Features
	•	Synchronous log/event capture
	•	Strict header/body record structure
	•	Unlimited or ring-buffer storage
	•	Deterministic timing metadata
	•	Explicit clone control
	•	Per-bucket configuration
	•	Manager-level defaults
	•	Workspace propagation
	•	Best-effort hooks and printing
	•	No async assumptions
	•	No transport assumptions

⸻

What this library does not do

This project is intentionally scoped.

It does not:
	•	Ship logs to a server
	•	Batch or retry network requests
	•	Perform sampling or aggregation
	•	Guarantee delivery
	•	Enforce schemas
	•	Provide async logging modes
	•	Act as a metrics or tracing system

Those belong in composed layers, not primitives.

Installation

This package is not yet available via npm or yarn.

Recommended (auto.js)

If you are already using m7-lib, the simplest setup is:

<script src="/path/to/m7-lib.min.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="/path/to/log/auto.js"></script>

This installs:

lib.primitive.log


⸻

Manual / Module usage

import { Manager, Worker } from './log/index.js';

m7-lib is required only when using auto.js.

Portfolio note

This project is designed as a systems-level logging primitive, not a convenience logger.

It demonstrates:
	•	Explicit responsibility boundaries
	•	Synchronous hot-path design
	•	Deterministic state handling
	•	Policy-free core architecture
	•	Composability over features
